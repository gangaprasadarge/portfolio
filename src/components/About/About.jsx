                I'm a data analyst with a talent for transforming complex data into insights
                that drive meaningful decisions. Experienced with Power BI, Tableau, Excel, SQL, and Python, I
                excel in creating visualizations and reports that simplify data for actionable results.
                My technical skills, paired with a strong grasp of business objectives, enable me to
                deliver insights that support strategic decision-making.
              </p>
              <p className="py-2">
                Currently, I'm pursuing a Bachelor of Technology in Computer Science and Engineering at
                Lovely Professional University. My studies and hands-on projects, like MIS reports and user behavior
                tracking systems, have given me a solid foundation in data analytics and business intelligence.
              </p>
              <p className="py-2">
                In addition to my passion for data analytics, I am also an experienced 3D designer, working with tools like
                Unity and Blender. I use Unity for developing interactive 3D experiences and games, while Blender
                allows me to create highly detailed 3D models and animations. I enjoy exploring both the artistic and technical
                sides of 3D design and am always eager to learn new techniques to enhance my creative work.
              </p>
              <p className="py-2">
                Outside of work, I'm a fan of movies and gaming, both of which keep me inspired and fuel my
                passion for storytelling and problem-solving. Iâ€™m eager to bring my expertise in data analytics, 3D design, and
                Python programming to a collaborative team where I can help foster a data-driven culture and make an impact.
